# Bacteriophage-bacteria interaction simulation

This repository contains the LAMMPS Langevin dynamics simulation of the interaction between dumbbell molecules representing bacteriophages subject to brownian motion and interacting between one another via a WCA force, while the others represent the celular wall of bacteria in order to understand their dynamics. Work by J.C. Perez-Ramirez under the supervision of Dr. F. Alarcon-Oseguera.
